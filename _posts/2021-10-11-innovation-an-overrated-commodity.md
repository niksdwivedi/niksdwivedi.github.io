Overrated and still poorly understood, ‘**innovation**’ is one of the most popular and most sought-after concepts and it seems to take the top spot everywhere. The word itself is enough to remind us about the wonderful work by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, chiefs of Google and Tony Stark, to name a few. 

We want to be part of the bandwagon one way or the other. Some want to work for such companies or people. Others look for ways to possess symbols of these innovations in form of mobile phones, countless apps in them, a voice-based digital personal assistant, a smartwatch, and many more. The recent growth of the start-up ecosystem has made us believe more in this art of innovation and looking outside the box.

We often think of innovation as something big - conquering Mars, building virtual reality, a self-driven car or even a car that can fly. What we see as one big innovation is a collection of many smaller ones. Innovation does not necessarily have to be a big idea, just that one minor thing could be our innovation. A lot of time we confuse "invention" with "innovation".

Life is made up of thoughts, ideas, learnings and stories, you could represent them with dots. Each one of us has our own set of dots to look at. When these dots intersect, it creates a new pattern - and that is innovation. Often, these ideas will look familiar and obvious. While these ideas have always existed, the combination was new and unheard of. It is the new way of solving the old problem, sometimes even the problem that the world did not know existed. When you make that one web page smother, it is innovation. When you improve the error logging mechanism and improve issue resolution, it is innovation. When you make your app easier for the disabled, you are innovating. When you are making things easier and better for them, you are an innovator. Modifying that one stored procedure to enables the database to serve more queries, or modifying a Powershell script to make each builds 2 minutes faster is all innovations. 

There is an interesting anecdote about it. Once a high-profile team at a toothpaste company was exploring options for increasing sales. A lot of ideas, from renewing product lines to decorating shelf space, were considered. It was then an experienced chap gave the idea of increasing the diameter of the rim of the tube. It will result in increased consumption and thus increased sales. 

Adding grease and lubrication to the pulley is a wonderful example of innovation. Today, it might seem so obvious, someday it must have been a revolutionary idea. In the recent unfortunate time of the coronavirus pandemic, we saw a range of innovations happening across various industries. You may have noticed (or maybe not) several innovations around you or maybe within your team. Working from home appears so obvious today, it was a distant dream and even impossible for various projects in the pre-pandemic era. Restaurants across the globe, even Michelin star fine dining restaurants adapted to the concepts of food delivery and modified kitchens to meet the needs. Businesses across the globe evolved to survive, sustain, make the best use of resources and reduce wastage. 

Innovation happens where there is curiosity, openness to the ideas of others, imagination and possibility.  Unlike invention, a majority of innovations do not require big labs and multi-million dollar manufacturing units. They require the search for betterment and simplicity. Understanding the current mechanics of how something works and then improving is a wonderful starting point. 

It is in the best interest of an organisation to provide a conducive ecosystem for its people to innovate and build something new. This ecosystem is sometimes mistaken to be technologically advanced labs and the usage of the latest technology stack just for sake of it. I am afraid, the real ingredients required to innovate could not be far from these. 

An ecosystem where a group of like-minded people are able to spend time thinking about problems, engage in constructive group discussions, guilds and invoke design thinking goes a long way. Organisations do endeavour to provide such an environment to their employees. It is also an individual's responsibility to engage in constructive idea-sharing meet-ups, knowledge pollination and increase cognitive intelligence by looking at more dots. With more dots, more patterns emerge and it provides a favourable breeding ground for innovative ideas - a commodity that we all trade in.
