# Hi, I am Nikhil

I am an avid book reader, technology enthusiast, philosopher, poem lover, storyteller and an artist at my heart. I think this word needs a lot more of artists and poets.

During the day, I develop Software that solve critical problems for enterprises. For a long time in my career I have been solving technological problems for Banks and Financial Institutions and helping them enhance their digital reach. At work, I juggle between the role of an Advisory and an Engineer <<my thoughts>>. My ability to see technology with lenses of business and business with lenses of technology helps me find the daily juice to survive.

When I am not working, I may be found reading a book or pondering over thoughts of reading one. I try to find time to listen to Poems and [Ghazals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazal).
